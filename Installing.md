Installing
==========

This section will explain how Quixote can be installed on your machine.

## Installing Python3 and pip

**Quixote** leverages the Python language in order to provide a clean and simple API for scripting automated jobs. Thus, its only dependency is Python 3, and it can then be installed through pip.

If you don't have Python 3 installed on your machine yet, you can obtain it by reading [the official installation instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

To verify your installation, you can try the following commands in your terminal, and ensure that your versions are equivalent to or higher than those in the output below :

```
> python3 --version
Python 3.7.3
> pip3 --version
pip 18.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

## Installing Quixote

Once Python and pip are properly installed, Quixote can be obtained from pip using a single command :

```bash
> pip3 install donquixote
```

## Installing Panza

Just like Quixote, Panza can be obtained from pip :

```
> pip3 install panza
```
